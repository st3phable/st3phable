### Hi there, I'm Stephanie 👋

I am a Computer Science & Biology student at **Purdue Fort Wayne** bridging the gap between biological data and software engineering.

Previously, I interned at **Microsoft**, where I learned to build scalable systems. Now, I apply those skills to **Computational Psychiatry**.

#### 🔬 Current Research Projects
- 🧬 **[Schizophrenia Genomic Pipeline](https://github.com/st3phable/schizophrenia-gene-pipeline)**: Automated RNA-Seq analysis using Python & SciPy.
- 🧠 **[Neural Circuit Visualizer](https://github.com/st3phable/neural-visualizer)**: React-based simulation of E/I balance and manic/sedated states.
